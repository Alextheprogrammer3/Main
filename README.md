# Alex Hernandez - Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Alex! I have a technical background and hold a Bachelor's Degree from the University of California San Diego, with a major in Communications. I started as an IT support student at UCSD and gradually gravitated towards communications and data science once I discovered my passion for it. One day, I saw a lot of kids coding and programming in my dorm, which made me wonder if I could give it a shot and see if there was potential for me in that field. I studied relentlessly and came up with some projects that I really enjoyed making. Since then, I have never looked back.
